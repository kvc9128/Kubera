# Kubera
A project that simulates the NYSE through a server client architecture. The server does webscraping through the use of an
external API(HtmlUnit) and allows clients to connect and interact with stocks and add/drop them from their portfolio. Building
a working server client model is phase I(Complete). Phase II involves analysing and modelling the data of the past 5 years of the
NYSE to help predict future stock prices and composite index. This part involves the use of libraries like TensorFlow, Pandas,
NumPy etc. This project may or may not have a future phase III which may involve developing a mobile version.
